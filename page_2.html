                        In ES6 and later there is a shorthand syntax for
                        defining functions.It is called arrow function. arrow
                        functions are most commonly used when you want to pass
                        an unamed function as an argument to another fuction.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        const plus = x => x+1
                        <i>// the input x maps to output x+1.</i>
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        when functions are assigned to properites of objects we
                        call them methods. we can define our own methods too.The
                        this keyword refers to the object on which the method is
                        defined. javascript supports object orineted programming
                        whick is significantly different from classical object
                        oriented programming.

                    <h2>Lexical structure</h2>
                    <br /><br />
                    <p>
                        The lexical structure of a programming language is set
                        of elementary rules which states how you write prgrammes
                        in that language.

                    <h4>2.1</h4>
                    <p>
                        javascript is a case sensitive language.javascript
                        ignores spaces between tokens in program.It also ingnore
                        line breaks
                    </p>
                    <h4>2.5</h4>
                    <p>
                        javascript programs are written using unicode character
                        set and you can use any unicode charater in strings and
                        comments. The language also allows use of unicode digits
                        , letters, ideographs but not emojis in identifiers.
                    </p>
                    <h5>2.5.1</h5>
                    <p>some computer hardware and software cannot output or process the full set of unicode characters. To support these systems 
                        javascript defines escape sequences that allow us to write unicode characters using ASCII characters. The uicode escapes begin 
                         with characters \u either followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits or one to six  hexadecimal digits in curly brackets.
