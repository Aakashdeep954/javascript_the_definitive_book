                    <h4>3.6 Symbols</h4>
                    <p>
                        Symbols were introduced in ES6 to serve as non string
                        property names.javascript fundamental object type is an
                        unordered collection of properties where each property
                        has name and value.property names were typically strings
                        but since ES6 symbols can also be used.To obtain a
                        Symbol vaue we call symbol fuction.This fuction never
                        returns same value even if we pass same argument.

                    <h4>3.7 Global object</h4>
                    <p>
                        global object is a regular javascript object that serves
                        a very important purpose. The properties of this object
                        are globally defined identifiers that are available to
                        javascript program.when javascript interpreter starts,
                        it creats a new global object and gives it an initial
                        set of properties that define. Global constats
                        Nan,undefined and infinity. Global functions such as
                        isNaN(),parseInt(),eval().

                        3.8 Immutable primitive values and mutable object
                        references
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There is fundamental difference between primitive values
                        and objects. Primitives are immutable whereas objects
                        are mutable.primitives are compared by value.Objects are
                        not compared by value. Two objects are equal even if
                        they have same properites and values.Two distinct arrays
                        are equal if they have same elements in same order. TWo
                        objects are same if and only if they refer to same
                        underlying object.

                    <h4>3.9 Type conversions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is very flexible about type conversions.If
                        javascript wants a string it will convert whatever the
                        value you give it to a string.If javascript wants a
                        number it will convert whatever the value you give it to
                        a number or to NaN if it cannot perform a meaningful
                        conversion.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3.10 Variable declaration and assignment</h4>
                    <p>
                        one of the fundamental techniques of computer
                        programming is the use of indentifiers to represent
                        values. Binding a value to a name gives us a way to
                        refer to the value and use it int the programs.The term
                        variable implies the value it contains can vary as the
                        program runs.In ES6 onwards variables are declared using
                        let and constant.
