                    <h5>6.10.1 Shorthand properties</h5>
                    <p>
                        suppose you have a values stored in variables x and y
                        and want tot create an object with properites x and y
                        that hold the values.With basic object literal
                        systax,you end up repeating each identifier twice. In
                        ES6 and later, you can drop the colon and one copy of
                        the identifier and end up with much simpler code.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.10.2 Computed property names</h5>
                    <p>
                        sometimes you need to create an object with a specific
                        property,but the name of the property is not a compile
                        time constant that you can type literally in your source
                        code.Instead, the property name you need is stored in a
                        variable or is the return value of a fuction.You cant
                        use a basic object literal syntax instead you have to
                        create an object and then add the desired properties as
                        an extra step.In ES6 or later it is much simpler to set
                        up an object with computed property feature that lets
                        you take the square brackets from the preceding code and
                        move them directly into the object literal. <br />
                        const PROPERTY_NAME = "p1";<br />
                        function computePropertyName() {return "p" + 2;}<br />
                        let p = { <br />
                        [PROPERTY_NAME]: 1, <br />
                        [computePropertyName()]: 2 <br />
                        }; <br />
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.10.3 Symbols as property names</h5>
                    <p>
                        The computed property syntax enables one other very
                        important object literal feature.In ES6 and
                        later,property names can be strings or symbols. If you
                        assign a symbol to a variable or constant then you can
                        use that symbol as a property name using the computed
                        property syntax.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.10.4 Spread Operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        In ES2018 and later, you can copy the properties of an
                        existing object into a new object using the spread
                        operator inside an object literal.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.10.5 Shorhand methods</h5>
                    <p>
                        Prior to ES6 you would define a method in an object
                        literal using a function definition expression just as
                        you would define any other property of an object.In ES6
                        and later the object literal syntax has been extended to
                        allow a shortcut where the function keyword and the
                        colon are omitted.
