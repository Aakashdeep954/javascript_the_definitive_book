                    <h4>6.1 Introduction to objects</h4>
                    <p>
                        An object is a composite value.It contains multiple
                        values and allows you to store and retrieve thoes values
                        by name.An object is undorderd collection of properties
                        each of which has a name and value.Property names are
                        usually strings,so we can say that objects maps strings
                        to values.javascripts also inherits properties from
                        another object known as prototype.Each property has
                        three property attributes.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The writable attribute specifies whether the value
                            of the property can be set.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The enumerable attribute specifies whether the
                            property name is returned by a for/in loop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The cofigurable attribute specifies whether the
                            property can be deleted and altered.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Many built in javascript objects are read only , non
                        enumerable, non configurable. However by default user
                        defined objects are writable, enumerable, configurable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>6.2 creating objects</h4>
                    <p>
                        objects can be created using object literal, the new
                        keyword, and using object.create() fuction.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.2.2 Creating objects with new</h5>
                    <p>
                        The new operator creates and initializes a new
                        object.The new keyword must be followed by a function
                        invocation. A fuction used in this way is called
                        constructor and serves to initialze newly created
                        object.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.2.3 Prototypes</h5>
                    <p>
                        Almost every object has a second object associated with
                        it.This second object is known as prototype and the
                        first object inherits properties from the prototype.
                    </p>
