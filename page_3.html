                    <h4>3.1</h4>
                    <p>
                        javascript types are divided into two catergories
                        primitive types and object types. javascript primitive
                        types include numbers,strings,booleans.Null and
                        undefined are primitive values.Symbols are added in
                        ES6Anything which is not anyone one of these is object.
                        An object is a collection of properties where each
                        property has a name and value. jacascript differes from
                        static laguages in that fucitons and classes are not
                        just the syntax but they area themselves values that can
                        be manipulated by javascript programs.classes and
                        funtions are specilised kind of object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        javascript supports object oriented programming style
                        means rather than having globally defined functions to
                        operate on values of various types the types themselves
                        define methods for working with values.To sort an array
                        we dont pass array to sort function instead we invoke
                        the sort method.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        javascript object types are mutable and primitive types
                        are immutable. a value of a mutable types can change.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3.2 Numbers</h4>
                    <p>
                        javascript primary numeric type, Number is used to
                        represent intergers and to approximate real numbers.
                        javascript uses 64 bit floating point format defined by
                        IEEE 754 standard.It can represent numbers as large as
                        &#177;1.7976931348623157 × 10<sup>308</sup> 8 and as
                        small as &#177;5 × 10<sup>−324</sup>.
                    </p>

                    <h5>3.3.1 Sting literals</h5>
                    <p>
                        To include string in javascript program simply enclose
                        the characters of the string with matching pair of
                        single quotes or double qotes or back ticks. The
                        original javascript version required string literals to
                        written on sinlge line. In ES5 you can break a string
                        literal into multipe lines by ending each line with a
                        backslash .The back slash and the line terminator are
                        not part of the string literal.In ES6 we can use
                        backticks to break string into multiple lines but line
                        terminator is now part of the string literal.
