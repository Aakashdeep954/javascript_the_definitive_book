                    <h5>4.9.3 The in operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        The in operator expects left operand to be a
                        string,symbol,or any value that can be converted to a
                        strings.It expects right operand to be an object.It
                        evaluates to true if left hand side value is the
                        property name in the object.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.9.4 The instanceOf operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        The instance of operator expects left hand side operand
                        to be an object and right hand side operand to be class
                        of objects.The operator evaluates to true if the left
                        side object is the instance of the right side class
                        false otherwise.In javascript classes of objects are
                        defined by the constructor function that
                        initializes.Thus the right hand side operand of the
                        instanceOf operator should be a function.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.10.1 The logical and</h5>
                    <p>
                        The logical and evaluates to true if the both operands
                        are true.It starts by evaluating the left operand, if it
                        is false it returns the first operand otherwise returns
                        the second operand.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.13.1 The conditional operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        The conditional operator is the only ternary operator in
                        javascript. The operands of the conditional operator can
                        be of any type.The first operand is evaluated and
                        interpreted as boolean.If the value of the first operand
                        is truthy then the second operand is evaluated and
                        returned othewise third operand is evaluated and
                        returned.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.13.2 The first defined operator(??)</h5>
                    <p>
                        The first defined operator evaluates to its first
                        defined operand if its left operand is not null and
                        udefined,othewise it evaluates to second operand.?? is
                        an alternative to || when you want to select the first
                        defined opernad rather than first truthy value.This
                        operator is formally called the nullish coalescing.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.13.3 The typeOf operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        typeOf operator is a unary operator which is paced
                        before the operand,which can be of any type.Its value is a string that specifies the 
                        type of operand.
