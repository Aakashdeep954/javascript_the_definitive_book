                    <h5>4.13.4 The delete operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        delete is a unary operator that attempts to object
                        property or an array element specified as its
                        operand.when a property is deleted, the property ceases
                        to exist. Attempting to read a non existent property
                        returns undefined.Deleting an array element leaves a
                        hole but does not change the array length.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4.13.5 The await operator</h5>
                    <p>
                        Await was introduced in 2017 as a way to make
                        asynchronous programming more natural in
                        javascript.Await expects a promise object as operand.It
                        does not block other asynchronous operations from
                        proceding at the same time.

                            The javascript + operator is used to add numbers and
                            concatenate strings.

                            The logical &&,|| operators have special short
                            circuiting behavior and sometimes one evaluate one
                            of their arguments.

                    <h5>5.4.4 for of</h5>
                    <p>ES6 defines a new loop statement.This new kind of loop uses for key word but completely different from the regular 
                        for loop and the older for in loop.The for of loop works with the ierable objects.If you want to iterate objects you 
                        can use for of with objects.keys() of object.values() or object.entries().
