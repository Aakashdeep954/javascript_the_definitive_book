                    <h5>6.2.4 Object.create()</h5>
                    <p>
                        object.create() creates a new object using its first
                        argument as the prototype of that object.you can pass
                        null to create a new object that does not have a
                        prototype,but if you do this the newly created object
                        will not inherit anything
                    </p>
                    <h4>6.3 Querying and setting properties</h4>
                    <p>
                        To obtain the value of a property ue the dot or square
                        bracket operations.The left hand side must be an
                        expression whose value is an object.If using the dot
                        operator the right hand side must be a simpler
                        identifier that names the property.If using square
                        brackets the value within the brackets must be an
                        expression that evaluates to a string.
                    </p>
                    <h4>6.4 Deleting properites</h4>
                    <p>
                        the delete operator removes a property form an
                        object.Its single operand should be a property access
                        expression.The delete operator only deletes own
                        properties,not inherited ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4>6.5 Testing properites</h4>
                    <p>
                        Javascript objects can be thought of as sets as
                        properites and it is often useful to be able to test for
                        membership in the set to check whether an objct ahs a
                        property with a given name.you can do this with the in
                        operator with the hasOwnProperty() and
                        propertyIsEnumerable() methods.
                    </p>
                    <h5>6.6.1 property Enumeration order</h5>
                    <p>
                        String properties whose names are non-negative integers
                        are listed first,in numeric order smallest to
                        largest.Then string names are listed in the order they
                        were added.Finally symbols are listed in the order they
                        were added.
                    </p>
                    <h4>6.8 serializing objects</h4>
                    <p>
                        object serializing is the process of converting an
                        object states to a string from which it can be restored
                        later. The funcitions json.stringify() and json.parse()
                        serialize and restore javascript objects.Json is a
                        subset of javascript syntax and it cannot represent all
                        javascript values.Objects,strings,finite
                        numbers,false,true,and null are supported.NaN,Infinity
                        and -Infinity are serialized to null.
