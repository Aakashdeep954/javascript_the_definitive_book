                        javascript is the programming language of the web. It is
                        the most deployed programming language in the last
                        decade. javascript is a high level,dynamic,loosely
                        typed,interpreted language that is well suited to object
                        oriented and functional programming.

                            <h4>High level language</h4>
                            It of type which is easily readable,understandable
                            by humans. It is converted to machine language by
                            compiler or interpreter.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Dynamic language</h4>
                            programming languages which convert source code into
                            machine code at run time. They do not check for
                            errors beforhand.It is possible to change type of a
                            variable while the program is running.

                            programming languages where we do not need to
                            explicitly specify the type of variable.

                        javascript was created at netscape in the early days of
                        the web. Due to trademark issues it stuck with the name
                        "ECMAScript". In practise everyone calls it javascript.
                        ES refers to language standard and versions of that
                        standard. ES6 was introduced in 2015 and is supported by
                        all the web browsers. ES6 introduced added major
                        features including class and module syntax that changed
                        javascript from a scripting language into a serious
                        general purpose language suitable for large-scale
                        software engineering. since ES6, the ECMAScript
                        specification has moved to a yearly release.
                        ES2016,ES2017,ES2018,ES2019,ES2020 are now identified by
                        year of release.

                        The core javascript does not include Input and output
                        functionality. It is carried out by the host
                        environment.The most common execution environment for
                        javascript is web browser. Nodejs is anoher environment
                        which gives javascript access to entire operating
                        system.

                        An expression is a javascript phrsase which evaluates to
                        produce a value. javascript statements are like full
                        sentences which can change the state of the prgram. A
                        function is a named and parameterised block of
                        javascript code that you define once and can invoke
                        again and again.Functions are values and can be assigned to variables.
