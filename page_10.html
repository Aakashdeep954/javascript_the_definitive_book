                    <h5>5.4.4 for in</h5>
                    <p>
                        a for in looks a lot like for of , with the of key word
                        changed to in.While the for of works with iterable
                        objects the for in works with any obect.The for in does
                        not loop all properties of an object.It does not
                        enumerate properties whose names are symbols.
                    </p>
                    <h5>5.5.1 labeled statements</h5>
                    <p>
                        Any statement may be labeled by preceding with an
                        identifier and a colon.By labeling a statement you give
                        a name that you can use to refer to it elswhere in the
                        program.
                    </p>
                    <h5>5.5.1 break statement</h5>
                    <p>
                        The breat statement used alone causes the innermost
                        enclosing loop or switch to exit immediately.Javascript
                        allows the break statement to be followed by a statement
                        label.When break is used with label,it jumps to the end
                        of or terminates the enclosing statement that has the
                        specified label.
                    </p>
                    <h5>5.5.6 throw</h5>
                    <p>
                        An exception is signal that indicates that some sort or
                        error has occured.To throw an exception is to signal
                        such an error To catch an expression is to hadle it.In
                        javascript exceptions are thrown whenever runtime error
                        occurs and whenever explicitly throws one using the
                        throw statement.Exceptions are caught using
                        try/catch/finally statement.
                    </p>
