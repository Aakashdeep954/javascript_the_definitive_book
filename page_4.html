                    <h5>3.3.2 Sting literals</h5>
                    <p>
                        The backslash has a special purpose in javascript.It
                        represents a character that is otherwise not
                        representable.
                    </p>
                    <h5>3.3.2 working with strings</h5>
                    <p>
                        one of the built in features of javascript is the
                        ability to concatenate strings.The + operator adds if
                        used with numbers but concatenates if used with
                        strings.Strings can be compared with standard === and
                        !== operators. Two strings are equal if and only if both
                        have same sequence of 16 bit values.Strings are
                        immutable in javascript, so the methods like replace()
                        and toUpperCase return new string.They do not modify the
                        string on which they are invoked.
                    </p>
                    <h5>3.3.4 Template literals</h5>
                    <p>
                        In ES6 onwards stirngs can be delimmited by using back
                        ticks. This is more than just another string literal,
                        because it can also include arbitary javascript
                        expressions which are computed and then converted into
                        stirngs.
                    </p>
                    <h5>3.3.5 pattern matching</h5>
                    <p>
                        javascript defines a data type known as regular
                        expressions for describing and matching strings of text.
                        Regular expressions are not fundamental datatypes but
                        they do have literal syntax and seem like a fundamental
                        data type.The grammar of regular expression is quiet
                        complex and the api they provide is non trivial.Text
                        between two slashes is regular expression literal
                        syntax.The second slash can be followed by a letter
                        which modifies the meaning of the pattern.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3.4 Boolean values</h4>
                    <p>
                        a boolean value represents truth or false,on or off,yes
                        or no.Javascript values can be converted into boolean
                        values. The values that work as false area
                        null,undefined,0,-0,NaN,"". All other values including
                        objects and arrays convert to and work like truth.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3.5 null and undefined</h4>
                    <p>
                        null is a key word that evaluates to a special value
                        which indicates absence of value,using typeOf operator
                        on null returns string object indicating null can be
                        thought of a special object.javascript has a second
                        value which indicates absence of value that is the
                        undedined. It is a value when variables are not
                        initialised or the vaue you get when you query value of
                        an object or an array element which does not exist.The undifined value is also the return value of 
                        a function which do not explicitly return a value.
